# mriLab-i3M

The Magnetic Resonance Imaging Laboratory (MRILab) at i3M in Valencia blends quantum and biomedical physicists and engineers. We build unique scanners and techniques with the goal of pushing the limits of MR Imaging in terms of accessibility and application niches. One of our strengths lies on the ability to advance the capabilities of current technologies by combining deep, abstract knowledge about fundamental scientific mechanisms with a good overview of existing, down-to-earth technical possibilities. Two major feats achieved by the group are: i) the first affordable MRI technology for combined visualization of hard and soft biological tissues and ii) the first truly portable MRI scanner.

# Ongoing projects in our github

## MaRGE (MaRCoS Graphical Environment)
Graphical environment based on MaRCoS to easily control low-field MRI scanners.

## Autotuning
Device controlled by arduino and nanoVNA to do automatic tuning/matching. It is integrated into MarGE.

## Interlock
Device that interrupt the current source of Barthel GPA in case current is too high. It also remotely control the Barthel GPA and RFPA by serial port.

## RF coil designer
Code in matlab to design rf coils. Different rf coils geometries will be placed in different branches.
